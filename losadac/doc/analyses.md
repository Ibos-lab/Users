# Analyses

## Selectivity
### 1st: Compute neurons selectivity with: /Users/losadac/selectivity/__ main__.py
The scrip saves a file called 'population_selectivity.pkl' in 
/envau/work/invibe/USERS/IBOS/data/Riesling/TSCM/OpenEphys/selectivity/
### 2nd: Compute plots using /Users/losadac/selectivity/population_selectivity.ipynb
This notebook save plots and:
* a file called: '{area}_no_neutral_inout_selectivity.csv' that contains neurons presenting no selectivity to neutral
sample inside the rf vs outside
* a file called: '{area}_neutral_inout_selectivity.csv' that contains neurons presenting selectivity to neutral
sample inside the rf vs outside
